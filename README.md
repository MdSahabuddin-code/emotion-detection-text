# Emotion Detection From Text
Developed a machine learning-based system to classify emotions expressed in textual data. Implemented data preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, feature extraction) and applied supervised learning models to detect emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, fear, and surprise. The project was built in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and includes a custom stopwords list for better text cleaning.

Key Highlights:

Preprocessed text using tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.

Built classification models using Na√Øve Bayes / Logistic Regression (or whichever you used).

Achieved [insert accuracy %] on the test dataset.

Developed as part of B.Sc. in Computer Science final-year project.
